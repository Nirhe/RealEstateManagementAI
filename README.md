# AI‑Powered Real Estate Management Platform

This repository contains the foundational backend for an AI‑driven real estate management system.  The goal of this project is to provide landlords and small property managers with a single API that streamlines day‑to‑day operations and offers predictive insights for better decision‑making.

## Overview

Property owners often juggle multiple responsibilities: collecting rent, tracking leases and expenses, staying on top of maintenance, researching the market and evaluating new investment opportunities.  Doing all of this manually wastes time and leaves money on the table.  This project aims to automate these tasks with a RESTful API built on .NET.

Key capabilities include:

- **Property & tenant management** – endpoints to store basic property details, tenants and leases, record income/expenses and expose a centralised dashboard of the portfolio.
- **Market analysis & ROI forecasting** – simple calculators for cap rate, cash‑on‑cash return and cash flow, with hooks for future machine‑learning based rent prediction and market trend forecasting.
- **Acquisition & portfolio optimisation** – placeholder endpoints to search for candidate investments, estimate ROI and track opportunities.

The current version is a starting point; most endpoints return sample data or empty collections.  You can extend the controllers and services to connect to a database, integrate external APIs or build AI agents.

## Tech stack

This backend is built with **.NET 8** using the minimal API pattern and ASP.NET Core.  A project file (`RealEstateManagement.API.csproj`) is provided along with a simple `Program.cs` that wires up controllers and Swagger for API documentation.  Models and controllers live under the `RealEstateManagement.API` folder.  You can run the project cross‑platform on Windows, macOS or Linux using the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Getting started

1. Install the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) if you do not have it.
2. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP and extract it locally.
3. Navigate to the API project and restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd AIRealEstateManagement/RealEstateManagement.API
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Build and run the API:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Once running, visit `https://localhost:5001/swagger` (or the URL printed in the console) to explore the auto‑generated Swagger UI and test endpoints.

## Next steps

This is an initial skeleton.  To turn it into a full‑featured platform you should:

* Connect to a database (e.g. PostgreSQL) using Entity Framework Core and implement CRUD operations in the controllers.
* Add authentication and authorization to secure endpoints.
* Integrate external services (MLS/Zillow, payment processors) to fetch real‑time data and process transactions.
* Implement business logic in separate services and leverage background jobs for tasks like scheduled rent reminders.
* Explore AI/ML models to predict rent, forecast market trends and recommend portfolio adjustments.

Pull requests and contributions are welcome as the project evolves.
